# iTRAC Analysis Notebooks
 Improved Tracking from Radar And CAN

This folder contains a series of notebooks that I have used to create plots and run analytics on the Radar and CAN vehicle distance data. The first script, ConvertCANData.py, should be used prior to other notebooks to ensure that the CAN data is formatted properly. This script exports a CSV file containing the Time and Message of each lead distance instance recorded. The exported file will be used in all further notebooks, along with the output.csv file of choice stored on CyVerse.

Please note the scripts were written in notebook notation, and are consequently not of the most organized coding style.
